# Sno-py

A personal code editor I've written for myself. Because why not?

### Implemented features

It's not so featured, it's missing a lot of things mainly because I don't use them or I was too lazy to add them.
- `w`, `q`, `wq`, `qa`, `wa`, `wqa` complete with ! as the force argument
- `o` to open files with path autocomplete
- `buffer` to change the active buffer (file). with autocomplete
- `!` to execute code using xonsh
- rc file, powered by [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh) supports both python and bash and python because why not
- colorscheme powered by pygments. There's no color scheme so everything is edited using the .snorc file
- bugs. yeah they are features too in my book
